                <h2>Our Story  <i class="fas fa-history"></i></h2>
                <p>
                    Coffee originated in East Africa, specifically Ethiopia, so as an Eritrean family of four (a neighbouring nation to Ethiopia, where coffee has a high status in its culture), 
                    it was a dream to open a Café that would bless people with an exceptional quality cup of coffee for an affordable price.
                </p>   
                <p>
                    This dream led to the first branch of The Coffee Joint opening in Harlesden in 2013, one of London's most impoverished and violent neighbourhoods, but it was—and still is—where we call home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a small family business, it was our aim to expand all across London.
                    We are extremely proud to say that we have achieved this so our next step is to have branches set up across the UK!
                </p>

                <p>
                    We aim to develop long lasting relationships with our customers, providing you with a sense of joy 
                    and warmth on your every visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have been blessed by the success of our Café so we are happy to give back! 
                    We understand wholeheartedly what it feels like to not being able to afford basic necessities in life. 
                    This is why giving people a sense of belonging is important to us, so those who are unable 
                    to afford a cup of our coffee are able to have one on us!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were also students once a upon a time. We know how it feels to have a job on the side whilst studying and the stress that comes with it. 
                    We want to be able to relieve their stress by offering 50% of any drink on the menu!
