[View my live project here](https://8000-dinakidane-thecoffeejoi-dzy8zyltpkb.ws-eu85.gitpod.io/index.html)

The Coffee Joint website facilitates the promotion of a fictitious London-based cafe company. The company specialises in the sale of various caffeinated and decaffeinated drinks. This is followed by a small selection of pastries and bakery. Those who identify as coffee enthusiasts are the target audience for the website. In addition to coffee enthusiasts, it concentrates on those who want to broaden their coffee palate by utilising the diversity of beverages available. The Coffee Joint is the best spot to obtain coffee because of its relatable history as well as the high calibre of the brew. The website is helpful for anyone who want to know where we are located, what products we sell and when we are open.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature that would be implemented in the future is a sticky navigation bar, specifically in the homepage. 
- This would have made it easier for online users to navigate between pages or parts of a website while keeping track of where they are in relation to the page's scrolling. 
- It also would've made it quicker for them to browse the site.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

- A consistent shade of brown is used throughout the website. The transparency of the brown is aimed to bring out the main image more. 
- The image below shows the 3 different shades of brown. These shades of brown were used consistently, as they were considered to be suitable to use as it fits in with the theme of coffee and cafes. 

![Colour](./assets/images/colour-scheme.png)

### Imagery

- The main image used remains throughout the site. This ensures that the online user, especially a new user, does not feel overwhelmed with a lot of images. Hence, the simplicity in using only one main image throughout the site.

### Typography 

- Pairing the Roboto and Montserrat font styles together was to bring out a modern feel to the website, as well as maintain simplicity and a clear read for the user. 

## Technologies Used

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was imported onto the style.css file to ensure that Robot and Montserrat was used throughout the site
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5/search) was used to insert icons for the social media platforms and the icons in the home and menu page to represent the subtitle that it was next to. This was used to enhance aestheic appeal.
