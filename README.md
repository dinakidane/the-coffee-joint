[View my live project here](https://8000-dinakidane-thecoffeejoi-dzy8zyltpkb.ws-eu85.gitpod.io/index.html)

The Coffee Joint website facilitates the promotion of a fictitious London-based cafe company. The company specialises in the sale of various caffeinated and decaffeinated drinks. This is followed by a small selection of pastries and bakery. Those who identify as coffee enthusiasts are the target audience for the website. In addition to coffee enthusiasts, it concentrates on those who want to broaden their coffee palate by utilising the diversity of beverages available. The Coffee Joint is the best spot to obtain coffee because of its relatable history as well as the high calibre of the brew. The website is helpful for anyone who want to know where we are located, what products we sell and when we are open.
